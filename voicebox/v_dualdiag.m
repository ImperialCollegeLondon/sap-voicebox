%V_DUALDIAG Simultaneous diagonalisation of two hermitian matrices [A,D,E]=(W,B)
% Inputs:   W,B     Two square hermitian matrices
%
% Outputs:  A       Diagonalizing matrix (not normally unitary or hermitian)
%           D       Real diagonal matrix elements: A'*B*A=diag(D) (see note below)
%           E       Real diagonal matrix elements: A'*W*A=diag(E)
%
% Note: At least one of W and B must be either positive definite or negative
% definite. If this is not the case, then D=A'*B*A and E=A'*W*A will be
% complex hermitian matrices rather than being vectors of real diagonal elements.
%
% The columns of A will be ordered so that abs(D./E) is in descending order.
% If two output arguments are given then A will be scaled to make diag(E)=I
% but, if W is singular, this will cause some elements of A to be infinite.
%
% If A'*B*A=diag(D) and A'*W*A=diag(E) then A'*W*A*diag(1./E)=I so A'*B*A=A'*W*A*diag(D./E)
% and hence B*A=W*A*diag(D./E) so the columns of A are the eigenvectors of W\A or
% equivalently the generalized eigenvectors of (B,W).
%
% Suppose we have several N-dimensional data row-vectors arising from each of C different classes of data.
% for each class, c, we can form the mean data vector m(c) and the within-class covariance matrix W(c)
% We can then form the between class covariance matrix B by taking the covariance of the mean vectors m(1), m(2), ...
% and also the averaged within-class covariance matrix W by averaging W(1), W(2), ...
% If we then take A=v_dualdiag(W,B) and postmultiply all our original data vectors by A, we obtain new
% data vectors for which the average within-class covariance matrix is the identity and for which
% the first few components contain most of the information that is useful in discriminating between classes.
