function s=v_phon2sone(p)
%V_PHON2SONE convert PHON loudness values to SONEs s=(p)
%Inputs:    p is a matrix of phon values
%
%Outputs:   s is a matrix, the same size as p, of sone values
%
% The phon scale measures perceived loudness in dB; at 1 kHz it is identical to dB SPL
% relative to 20e-6 Pa sound pressure. The sone scale is proportional to apparent loudness
% and, by definition, equals 1 at 40 phon. The form of the loudness curve is taken from [1].
% The hearing threshold at 1 kHz for 18 to 25 year olds with normal hearing is taken from [2].
