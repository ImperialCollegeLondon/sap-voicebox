function [m,a]=v_lpcstable(ar)
%V_LPCSTABLE Test AR coefficients for stability and stabilize if necessary [MA,A]=(AR)
%
% Usage: (1) [m,ar]=v_lpcstable(ar); % force ar polynolials to be stable
%
%   Input:  ar(:,p+1)  Autoregressive coefficients
% Outputs:  m(:,1)    Mask identifying stable polynomials
%           a(:,p+1)  Stabilized polynomials formed by reflecting unstable
%                       poles in unit circle (with a(:,1)=1)
