function [am,em]=v_lpcar2am(ar,p);
%V_LPCAR2AM Convert ar coefs to ar coef matrix [AM,EM]=(AR,P)
%AM is a 3-dimensional matrix of size (p+1,p+1,nf) where p is the lpc order
%and nf the number of frames.
%The matrix AM(:,:,*) is upper triangular with 1's on the main diagonal
%and contains the lpc coefficients for all orders from p down to 0.
%
%For lpc order p+1-r, AM(r,r:p+1,*), AM(p+1:-1:r,p+1,*) and EM(*,r) contain
%the lpc coefficients, reflection coefficients and the residual energy respectively.
%EM(:,1) is always 1.
%
%If A=am(:,:,*), R=toeplitz(rr(*,:)) and E=diag(em(*,:)), then
% A*R*A'=E; inv(R)=A'*(1/E)*A; A*R is lower triangular with the same diagonal as E
%
% For each j in 1:P we have AM(j:end:-1:j+1,*) = AM(j:end-1,end,*)'*am(j+1:end,j+1:end,*)
%
% Also em(*,1:end)' = em(*,2:end)'.*(1-am(1:end-1,end,*).^2)

% we should be able to do this more directly using the step down algorithm
