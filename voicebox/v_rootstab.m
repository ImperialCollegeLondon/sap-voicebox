function [no,ni,nc]=v_rootstab(p)
%V_ROOTSTAB determines the  number of polynomial roots outside, inside and on the unit circle [NO,NI,NC]=v_rootstab(P)
%
%  Inputs:  p   Polynomial with real or complex coefficients
%
% Outputs: no   Number of roots outside the unit circle
%          ni   Number of roots inside the unit circle
%          nc   Number of roots lying on the unit circle
%
% This routine uses the algorithm given in [1]. Rounding errors may cause roots that lie on the unit circle to migrate to either inside or outside.
