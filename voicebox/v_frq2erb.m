function [erb,bnd] = v_frq2erb(frq)
%V_FRQ2ERB  Convert Hertz to ERB frequency scale ERB=(FRQ)
%	erb = v_frq2erb(frq) converts a vector of frequencies (in Hz)
%	to the corresponding values on the ERB-rate scale on which
%  	the human ear has roughly constant resolution as judged by
%  	psychophysical measurements of the cochlear filters. The
%   inverse function is v_erb2frq.

%   The erb scale is measured using the notched-noise method [3].
%
%	We have df/de = 6.23*f^2 + 93.39*f + 28.52
%	where the above expression gives the Equivalent Rectangular
%	Bandwidth (ERB)in Hz  of a human auditory filter with a centre
%	frequency of f kHz.
%
%	By integrating the reciprocal of the above expression, we
%	get:
%		e = a ln((f/p-1)/(f/q-1))
%
%	where p and q are the roots of the equation: -0.312 and -14.7
%  	and a = 1000/(6.23*(p-q)) = 11.17268
%
%	We actually implement e as
%
%		e = a ln (h - k/(f+c))
%
%	where k = 1000(q - q^2/p) = 676170.42
%         h = q/p = 47.065
%	      c = -1000q = 14678.49
%	and f is in Hz
