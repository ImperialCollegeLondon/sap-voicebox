function y=v_besselratio(x,v,p)
%V_BESSELRATIO calculate the Bessel function ratio besseli(v+1,x)./besseli(v,x)
%
%  Inputs: x    Bessel function argument (scalar or matrix)
%          v    denominator Bessel function order [0]
%          p    digits precision <=14 [5]
%
% Outputs: y    value of the Bessel function ratio besseli(v+1,x)./besseli(v,x)
%
% Uses an algorithm from [1] of which a pseudocode version is given in [2] but which has an misprint
% in the first line: "min" instead of "max". The iteration count and minimum initial order are made
% dependent on the required precision to improve efficiency.
% The inverse of r=v_besselratio(k,0) is available as the function k=v_besratinv0(r).
