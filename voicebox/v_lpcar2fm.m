function [n,f,a,b]=v_lpcar2fm(ar,t)
%V_LPCAR2RF Convert autoregressive coefficients to formant freq+amp+bw [N,F,A,B]=(AR,T)
%
% Input:   ar(:,p+1)  Autoregressive coefficients
%          t          Threshold (see below)
% Output:  n          Number of formants found
%          f          Formant frequencies in normalized Hz (in increasing order)
%          a          Formant amplitudes
%          b          Formant bandwidths in normalized Hz
%
% The number of columns in the output arrays f, a and b is max(n); surplus positions
% in any given row have f=b=0.
%
% In determining formants, poles are ignored if any of the following hold:
%        (a) they are on the real axis
%        (b) they have bandwidth > t*frequency (if t>0)
%        (c) they have bandwidth > -t (if t<=0)
