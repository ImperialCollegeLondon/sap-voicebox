function y=v_teager(x,d,m)
%V_TEAGER calculate v_teager energy waveform Y=(X,D,M)
%
%  Inputs:  x         speech signal
%           d         dimension to apply filter along [default 1st non-singleton]
%           m         Normally Y has the same length as X and the first
%                     and last output samples are extrapolated. Setting m='x'
%                     supresses this extrapolation and Y will be two
%                     samples shorter than X
%
% Outputs:  Y         output signal: y(n)=abs(x(n))^2 - x(n+1)*conj(x(n-1))
%
% Calculates the Teager energy waveform [1]. The following waveforms give
% a constant output (independent of n) where A, B, C are real constants:
%  (a) x(n) = A*sin(B*n+C)    -->   y(n) = (A*sin(B))^2
%  (b) x(n) = A*n + B         -->   y(n) = A^2
%  (c) x(n) = A*exp(j(B*n+C)) -->   y(n) = A^2*(1-exp(2jB))
%  (d) x(n) = A*exp(B*n+C)    -->   y(n) = 0
