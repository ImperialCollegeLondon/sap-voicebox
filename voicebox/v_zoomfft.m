function [y,f]=v_zoomfft(x,n,m,s,d)
%V_ZOOMFFT    DTFT evaluated over a linear frequency range Y=(X,N,M,S,D)
% Inputs:
%    x    vector (or matrix)
%    n    reciprocal of normalized frequency increment (can be non-integer).
%         The frequency increment is fs/n where fs is the sample frequency
%         [default n=size(x,d)]
%    m    mumber of output points is floor(m) [default m=n]
%    s    starting frequency index (can be non-integer).
%         The starting frequency is s*fs/n [default s=0]
%    d    dimension along which to do fft [default d=first non-singleton]
%
% Outputs:
%    y       Output dtft coefficients. y has the same dimensions as x except
%            that size(y,d)=floor(m).
%    f(1,m)  normalized frequencies (1 corresponds to fs)
%
% This routine allows the evaluation of the DFT over an arbitrary range of
% frequencies; as its name implies this lets you zoom into a narrow portion
% of the spectrum.
% The DTFT of X will be evaluated along dimension D at the M frequencies
% f=fs*(s+(0:m-1))/n where fs is the sample frequency. Note that N and S
% need not be integers although M will be rounded down to an integer.
% Thus v_zoomfft(x,n,n,0,d) is equivalent to fft(x,n,d) for n>=length(x).
