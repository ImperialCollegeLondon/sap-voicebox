function q=v_roteu2qr(m,e)
%ROTEU2QR converts a sequence of Euler angles to a real unit quaternion
% Inputs:
%
%     M        a string of n characters from the set determining the order of rotation axes
%              as listed below:
%                'x','y','z'    rotate around the given axis by the corresponding angle
%                               given in e()
%                '1','2','3'    90° rotation around x,y or z axis; doesn't use a value from e()
%                '4','5','6'    180° rotation around x,y or z axis; doesn't use a value from e()
%                '7','8','9'    270° rotation around x,y or z axis; doesn't use a value from e()
%                'r','d'        all angles are given in radians or degrees  [radians]
%             'o','O','a','A'   selects whether to rotate the object or the coordinate axes and
%                               whether the rotation axes remain fixed in space for consecutive
%                               rotations (extrinsic) or else move with each rotation (intrinsic).
%                                  'o' = object-extrinsic [default]
%                                  'O' = object-intrinsic
%                                  'a' = axes-extrinsic
%                                  'A' = axes-intrinsic
%
%     E(n,...) column vector of rotation angles in radians (or degrees if 'd' specified).
%              A positive rotation is clockwise if looking along the +ve axis away from the origin.
%              The x, y, z axes form a right-handed triple.
%
% Outputs:
%
%     Q(4,...)   output quaternion. Q is normalized to have magnitude 1 with
%                its first non-zero coefficient positive.
%
% The string M specifies the seqeunce of axes about which the rotations are performed. There are 12
% possible 3-character sequences that avoid consecutive repetitions. These are 'Euler angles' if
% there is a repeated axis or 'Tait-Bryan angles' if not. Common choices are:
% (1) 'zxz' the most common Euler angle set (including a replicated axis, z)
% (2) 'xyz' corresponds to 'roll, pitch, yaw' for an aeroplane heading in the x direction with y to
%     the right and z down. The intrinsic equivalent is 'Ozyx' corresponding to 'yaw, pitch, roll'.
% (3) 'z1z1z' involves 5 rotations, in which all the non-fixed rotations are around the z axis. 
%
% Inverse conversion: If m has length 3 with adjacent characters distinct,
%                     then v_rotqr2eu(m,v_roteu2qr(m,e))=e.
%
% Inverse rotation:   qrmult(roteu2qr(m,e),roteu2qr(fliplr(m),-fliplr(e)))=+-[ 1 0 0 0]'
