function [ar,arp,aru,g]=v_lpcrf2ar(rf)
%V_LPCRF2AR Convert reflection coefs to autoregressive coefs [AR,ARP,ARU,G]=(RF)
%
% Input:  RF(:,p+1) gives reflection coefficients of one or more p-section lossless tubes 
% Ouputs: G is the gain of the all-pole AR filter
%         AR/G is the transfer function from U_in to the glottal input wave, U_g.
%               AR(:,1)=1 always.
%         ARP*K is the transfer function from U_in to the pressure just after the glottis
%               where K = rho*c/Alips: rho = air density 1.23 kg/m^3, c=sound speed 340 m/s, 
%               Alips = effective area of free space beyond the lips.
%         ARU is the transfer function from U_in to the total volume velocity through the glottis
% 
%              where U_in=z^(p/2)*U_lips is the time-advanced volume velocity at the lips
%
%         Energy into the vcal tract is equal to K*filter(ARP,1,Ulips).*filter(ARU,1,Ulips)
%              reverse glottal flows divided by 1-r0 where r0 is the glottal reflection coefficient.
%              The scale factor is included to avoid a zero answer when the glottis is closed giving r0=1.
%
% The transfer functions have ar(:,1)=art(:,1)=1
% They should both be multiplied by z^(p/2)/prod(1+rf) to correct the absolute
% gain and to compensate for the delay of p/2 samples along the length of the tube.
%
% The energy into the vocal tract is given by ars(speech) * are(speech)
