%V_GAUSSMIXK approximate Kullback-Leibler divergence between two GMMs + derivatives
%
% Inputs: with kf & kg mixtures, p data dimensions
%
%   mf(kf,p)                mixture means for GMM f
%   vf(kf,p) or vf(p,p,kf)  variances (diagonal or full) for GMM f [default: identity]
%   wf(kf,1)                weights for GMM f - must sum to 1 [default: uniform]
%   mg(kg,p)                mixture means for GMM g [g=f if mg,vg,wg omitted]
%   vg(kg,p) or vg(p,p,kg)  variances (diagonal or full) for GMM g [default: identity]
%   wg(kg,1)                weights for GMM g - must sum to 1 [default: uniform]
%
% Outputs:
%   d             the approximate KL divergence D(f||g)=E_f(log(f(x)/g(x)))
%   klfg(kf,kg)   the exact KL divergence between the components of f and g
%
% The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, D(f||g), between two distributions,
% f(x) and g(x) is also known as the "relative entropy" of f relative to g.
% It is defined as <log(f(x)/g(x))> where <...> denotes the
% expectation with respect to f(x), i.e. <y(x)> = Integral(f(x) y(x) dx).
% The KL divergence is always >=0 and equals 0 if and only if f(x)=g(x)
% almost everywhere. It is not a distance because it is not symmetric
% between f and g and also does not satisfy the triangle inequality.
% It is normally appropriate for f(x) to be the "true" distribution and
% g(x) to be an approximation to it. See [1].
%
% This routine calculates the "variational approximation" to the KL divergence
% from [2] that is exact when f and g are single component gaussians and that is zero
% if f=g. However, the approximation may be negative if f and g are different.
