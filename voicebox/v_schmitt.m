function [y,t]=v_schmitt(x,thresh,minwid)
%V_SCHMITT Pass input signal X through a v_schmitt trigger
% SCHMITT(X,[LOW HIGH]) gives low and high thresholds. LOW and HIGH can be
% scalars or can be vectors specifiying different thresholds for each X element.
%
% SCHMITT(X,HYSTERESIS) specifies the thresholds as MAX-DELTA and MIN+DELTA where
% DELTA=(MAX-MIN)*(1-HYSTERESIS)/2 and MAX and MIN are the max and min of X.
% HYSTERESIS must be in the range 0 to 1 and represents the fraction of MAX-MIN between
% the two threshold values; default is 0.5.
%
% MINWID specifies the minimum width of a pulse (in samples). Pulses thinner than this will
% be ignored.
%
% Output Y takes values -1, +1 according to whether X<LOW or X>HIGH most recently.
% Y may be 0 for an initial segment if neither condition is initially true.
% For [Y,T]=SCHMITT(...) Y contains alternate +1 and -1 values and T contains
% the sample numbers at which X crossed the thresholds.
