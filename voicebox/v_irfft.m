function x=v_irfft(y,n,d)
%V_IRFFT    Inverse fft of a conjugate symmetric spectrum X=(Y,N,D)
%
% Inputs:  Y(M)   The first half of a complex spectrum
%          N      The number of output points to generate (default: 2M-2)
%          D      The dimension along which to perorm the transform
%                 (default: first non-singleton dimension of Y)
%
% Outputs: X(N)   Real inverse dft of Y
%
% This routine calculates the inverse DFT of a conjugate-symmetric to give a real-valued
% output of dimension N. Only the first half of the spectrum need be supplied: if N is even,
% this includes the Nyquist term and is of dimension M=N/2 + 1 whereas if N is odd then there is
% no Nyquist term and the input is of dimension M=(N+1)/2.
% The DC and (if present) Nyquist values are forced to be real before performing the transform.
% Note that the default value of N is always even so that N must be given explicitly
% if it is odd.
