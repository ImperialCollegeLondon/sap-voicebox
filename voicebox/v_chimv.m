function [m,v]=v_chimv(n,l,s)
%V_CHIMV approximate mean and variance of non-central chi distribution [m,v]=(n,l,s)
%
%  Inputs:	n = degrees of freedom
%           l = non-centrality parameter = sqrt(sum(mean^2)) [default 0]
%               (can be a vector or matrix to calculate many different values at once)
%           s = standard deviation of Gaussian [default 1]
%
% Outputs:  m = mean of chi distribution
%           v = variance of chi distribution
%
% If x=c+randn(n,1) is a column vector of Gaussian random numbers with mean vector c, then
% z=sqrt(x'*x) has a chi distributon with n degrees of freedom and non-centrality parameter
% l=sqrt(c'*c). The mean and variance of a chi distribution are given precisely by
%
%     m = sqrt(2)*exp(gammaln(0.5*n+0.5)-gammaln(0.5*n))*hypergeom(-0.5,0.5*n,-0.5*(l/s)^2)*s
%       = sqrt(pi/2) L(0.5,0.5*n-1,-0.5*(l/s)^2)*s
%     v = n*s^2+l^2-m^2
%
% where L(n,a,x) is the generalized Laguerre polynomial L_n^{(a)}(x) but this is very slow
% to calculate so this routine approximates these expressions.
% The expressions are from [1]  together with the following identities taken
% from [2] or [3]: 13.2.39, 13.6.19, 5.2.5, 5.4.1, 5.5.1, 5.4.6.
%
% For n=1, the accuracy is high; for n>1, accuracy improves with increasing n.
% Accuracy is worst when the non-centrality parameter, l, is close to s*sqrt(n).
% Worst case errors as a function of n are:
%                       n:    1       2      3       5      10
%   worst case error in m:  1e-15   0.007  0.004  0.0015  0.0005
