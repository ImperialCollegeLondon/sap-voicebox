function [frq,cr] = v_cent2frq(c)
%V_FRQ2ERB  Convert Hertz to Cents frequency scale [C,CR]=(FRQ)
%	frq = v_frq2mel(c) converts a vector of frequencies in cents
%	to the corresponding values in Hertz.
%   100 cents corresponds to one semitone and 440Hz corresponds to 5700
%   cents.
%   The optional cr output gives the gradient in Hz/cent.
%
%	The relationship between cents and frq is given by:
%
%	c = 1200 * log2(f/(440*(2^((3/12)-5)))
