function [frq,mr] = v_mel2frq(mel)
%V_MEL2FRQ  Convert Mel frequency scale to Hertz FRQ=(MEL)
%	frq = v_mel2frq(mel) converts a vector of Mel frequencies
%	to the corresponding real frequencies.
%   mr gives the corresponding gradients in Hz/mel.
%	The Mel scale corresponds to the perceived pitch of a tone

%	The relationship between mel and frq is given by [1]:
%
%	m = ln(1 + f/700) * 1000 / ln(1+1000/700)
%
%  	This means that m(1000) = 1000
