function [x,g,j,gg] = v_kmeans(d,k,x0,l)
%V_KMEANS Vector quantisation using K-means algorithm [X,ESQ,J]=(D,K,X0,L)
%
%  Inputs:
%
%    D(N,P)  contains N data vectors of dimension P
%    K       is number of centres required
%    X0(K,P) are the initial centres (optional)
%     
%      or alternatively
%
%    X0      gives the initialization method
%            'f'   pick K random elements of D as the initial centres [default]
%            'p'   randomly divide D into K sets and choose the centroids
%    L       gives max number of iterations (use 0 if you just want to calculate G and J)
%
%  Outputs:
%
%    X(K,P)  is output row vectors (omitted if L=0)
%    G       is mean square error
%    J(N)    indicates which centre each data vector belongs to
%    GG(L)   gives the mean square error at the start of each iteration (omitted if L=0)
%
% It is often a good idea to scale the input data so that it has equal variance in each
% dimension before calling V_KMEANS.
