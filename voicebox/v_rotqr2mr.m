function mr=v_rotqr2mr(qr)
%V_ROTQR2MR converts a matrix of real quaternion vectors to quaternion matrices
% Inputs:
%
%     QR(4m,n,...)   mxn matrix of real quaternion vectors (each 4x1)
%
% Outputs:
%
%     MR(4m,4n,...)   mxn matrix of real quaternion matrices (each 4x4)
%
% In matrix form, quaternions can be multiplied and added using normal matrix
% arithmetic. Each element of an mxn matrix of quaternions is itself a 4x4 block
% so the total dimension of MR is 4m x 4n.
