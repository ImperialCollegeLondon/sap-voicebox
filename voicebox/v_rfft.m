function y=v_rfft(x,n,d)
%V_RFFT     Calculate the DFT of real data Y=(X,N,D)
% Data is truncated/padded to length N if specified.
%   N even:	(N+2)/2 points are returned with
% 			the first and last being real
%   N odd:	(N+1)/2 points are returned with the
% 			first being real
% In all cases floor(1+N/2) points are returned
% D is the dimension along which to do the DFT
