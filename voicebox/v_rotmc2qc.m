function qc=v_rotmc2qc(mc)
%V_ROTMC2QC converts a matrix of complex quaternion matrices to a matrix of complex quaternion vectors
% Inputs:
%
%     MC(2m,2n,...)   mxn matrix of real quaternion matrices (each 2x2)
%
% Outputs:
%
%     QC(2m,n,...)   mxn matrix of real quaternion vectors (each 2x1)
%
% In matrix form, quaternions can be multiplied and added using normal matrix
% arithmetic. Each element of an mxn matrix of quaternions is itself a 2x2 block
% so the total dimension of MC is 2m x 2n.
