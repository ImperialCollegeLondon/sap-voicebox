function qr=v_rotqc2qr(qc)
%V_ROTQC2QR converts a matrix of complex quaternion row vectors into real form
%
% Inputs: 
%
%     QC(2m,...)   array of complex-valued quaternions
%
% Outputs: 
%
%     QR(4m,...)   array of real-valued quaternions
%
% The complex-valued quaternion [r+j*b  a+j*c] becomes [r a b c]
