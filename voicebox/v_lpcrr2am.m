function [am,em]=v_lpcrr2am(rr);
%V_LPCRR2AM Convert autocorrelation coefs to ar coef matrix [AM,EM]=(RR)
%AM is a 3-dimensional matrix of size (p+1,p+1,nf) where p is the lpc order
%and nf the number of frames.
%The matrix AM(:,:,*) is upper triangular with 1's on the main diagonal
%and contains the lpc coefficients for all orders from p down to 0.
%
%For lpc order p+1-r, AM(r,r:p+1,*), AM(p+1:-1:r,p+1,*) and EM(*,r) contain
%the lpc coefficients, reflection coefficients and the residual energy respectively.
%
%If A=am(:,:,*), R=toeplitz(rr(*,:)) and E=diag(em(*,:)), then
% A*R*A'=E; inv(R)=A'*(1/E)*A; A*R is lower triangular with the same diagonal as E
%
% This routine is equivalent to: c=chol(inv(toeplitz(rr))); d=diag(c).^-1; em=d.^2; am=diag(d)*c
