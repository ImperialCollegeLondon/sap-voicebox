function ar=v_lpcra2ar(ra,tol)
%V_LPCRA2AR Convert inverse filter autocorrelation coefs to AR filter. AR=(RA)
%
% Usage: (1) ar0=poly([0.5 0.2]);  % ar0=[1 -0.7 0.1]
%            ra0=v_lpcar2ra(ar0);    % ra0=[1.5 -0.77 0.1]
%            ar1=v_lpcra2ar(ra0);    % ar1 = ar0
%
%        (2) ar0=poly([0.5 0.2]);                   % ar0=[1 -0.7 0.1]
%            arx=xcorr(ar0);                        % arx=[0.1 -0.77 1.5 -0.77 0.1]
%            ar1=v_lpcra2ar(arx(length(ar0):end));    % ar1 = ar0
%
%  Inputs: ra(n,p+1) each row is the second half of the autocorrelation of
%                    the coefficients of a stable AR filter of order p
%          tol       tolerance relative to ra(1) [1e-8]
%
% Outputs: ar(n,p+1) each row gives coefficients of an AR filter of order p
%
% This routine uses a Newton-Raphson iteration described in [1] to invert
% the cross-correlation function (as in the second usage example above).
