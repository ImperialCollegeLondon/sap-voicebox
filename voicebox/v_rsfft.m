function x=v_rsfft(y,n)
%V_RSFFT    fft of a real symmetric spectrum X=(Y,N)
% Y is the "first half" of a symmetric real input signal and X is the
% "first half" of the symmetric real fourier transform.
% If the length, N, of the full signal is even, then the "first half"
% contains 1+N/2 elements (the first and last are excluded from the reflection).
% If N is odd, the "first half" conatins 0.5+N/2 elements and only the first
% is excluded from the reflection.
% If N is specified explicitly, then Y will be truncated of zero-padded accordingly.
% If N is omitted it will be taken to be 2*(length(Y)-1) and is always even.
%
% If Y is a matrix, the transform is performed along each column
%
% The inverse function is y=v_rsfft(x,n)/n

% Could be made faster for even n by using symmetry
