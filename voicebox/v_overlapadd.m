function [x,zo]=v_overlapadd(f,win,inc)
%V_OVERLAPADD join overlapping frames together X=(F,WIN,INC)
%
% Usage for frequency-domain processing:
%       S=...;                              % input signal
%       OV=2;                               % overlap factor of 2 (4 is also often used)
%       INC=20;                             % set frame increment in samples
%       NW=INC*OV;                          % DFT window length
%       W=sqrt(hamming(NW,'periodic'));     % omit sqrt if OV=4
%       W=W/sqrt(sum(W(1:INC:NW).^2));      % normalize window
%       F=v_rfft(v_enframe(S,W,INC),NW,2);      % do STFT: one row per time frame, +ve frequencies only
%       ... process frames ...
%       X=v_overlapadd(v_irfft(F,NW,2),W,INC);  % reconstitute the time waveform (omit "X=" to plot waveform)
%
% Inputs:  F(NR,NW) contains the frames to be added together, one
%                   frame per row.
%          WIN(NW)  contains a window function to multiply each frame.
%                   WIN may be omitted to use a default rectangular window
%                   If processing the input in chunks, WIN should be replaced by
%                   ZI on the second and subsequent calls where ZI is the saved
%                   output state from the previous call.
%          INC      gives the time increment (in samples) between
%                   succesive frames [default = NW].
%
% Outputs: X(N,1) is the output signal. The number of output samples is N=NW+(NR-1)*INC.   
%          ZO     Contains the saved state to allow a long signal
%                 to be processed in chunks. In this case X will contain only N=NR*INC
%                 output samples.
