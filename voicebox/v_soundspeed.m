function [v,d,z]=v_soundspeed(t,p,m,g)
%V_SOUNDSPEED gives the speed of sound, density of air and acoustic impedance as a function of temp & pressure [V,D,Z]=(T,P,M,G)
%
%  Inputs:  T        air temperature in Celsius  [20 deg C]
%           P        air pressure [1 atm]
%           M        average molecular weight of air [0.0289644 kg/mol]
%           G        adiabatic constant for air [1.4]
%
% Outputs:  V        is the speed of sound in m/s
%           D        density of air in kg/m^3
%           Z        characteristic impedance of air Pa.s/m

% Notes: (1) Sound pressure is often measured in dB (SPL) relative to 20uPa [20*log10(p/p0)]
%            Sound pressure is inversely proportional to distance.
%        (2) Sound intensity is often measured indB relative to pW/m^2,[10*log10(J*10^12)]
%            Intensity is inversely proportional to distance squared.
%        (3) Intensity * impedance = pressure^2, so with the default values, 1 pW/m^2 = sqrt(Z) = 20.33 uPa
%            So: X dB (SPL) = X-93.98 dB (Pa) = X-0.14 dB (pW/m^2) =  X-120.14 dB (W/m^2)
%            where 93.98=20*log10(50000), 0.14=10*log10(Z/400), 120.14=10*log10(1e12*z/400)
%        (4) The default air pressure (which does not affect sound speed) in various units is:
%            1 atm = 101325 Pa = 1.01325 bar = 1.0332 at = 760 torr = 14.696 psi
