function x=v_pcma2lin(p,m,s)
%V_PCMU2LIN Convert A-law PCM to linear X=(P,M,S)
%	lin = v_pcma2lin(pcma,m,s) where pcma contains a vector or matrix
%	of A-law values in the range 0 to 255.
%	No checking is performed to see that numbers are in this range.
%
%	Input values are exclusive ored with m (default=85)
%
%	Output values are divided by the scale factor s:
%
%		   s		Output Range
%
%		   1		+-4032	(integer values)
%		2017.396342	+-1.998616 (default)
%		4032		+-1
%		4096		+-0.984375 (+-1 nominal full scale)
%
%	The default value of s is 2017.396342 which equals
%	sqrt((1120^2 + 2624^2)/2). This factor follows ITU standard G.711 and
%	the sine wave with PCM-A values [225 244 244 225 97 116 116 97]
%	has a mean square value of unity corresponding to 0 dBm0.
