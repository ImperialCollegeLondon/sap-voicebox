function d=v_distispf(pf1,pf2,mode)
%V_DISTISPF calculates the Itakura-Saito spectral distance between power spectra D=(PF1,PF2,MODE)
%
% Inputs: PF1,PF2     Power spectra to be compared. Each row represents a power spectrum: the first
%                     and last columns represent the DC and Nyquist terms respectively.
%                     PF1 and PF2 must have the same number of columns.
%
%         MODE        Character string selecting the following options:
%                         'x'  Calculate the full distance matrix from every row of PF1 to every row of PF2
%                         'd'  Calculate only the distance between corresponding rows of PF1 and PF2
%                              The default is 'd' if PF1 and PF2 have the same number of rows otherwise 'x'.
%           
% Output: D           If MODE='d' then D is a column vector with the same number of rows as the shorter of PF1 and PF2.
%                     If MODE='x' then D is a matrix with the same number of rows as PF1 and the same number of columns as PF2'.
%
% The Itakura-Saito spectral distance is the average over +ve and -ve frequency of 
%
%                      pf1/pf2 - log(pf1/pf2) - 1     =     exp(v) - v - 1         where v=log(pf1/pf2)
%
% The Itakura-Saito distance is asymmetric: pf1>pf2 contributes more to the distance than pf2>pf1. 
% A symmetrical version is the COSH distance: v_distchpf(x,y)=(v_distispf(x,y)+v_distispf(y,x))/2

% The Itakura-Saito distance can also be calculated directly from AR coefficients; providing np is large
% enough, the values of d0 and d1 in the following will be very similar:
%
%         np=255; d0=v_distisar(ar1,ar2); d1=v_distispf(v_lpcar2pf(ar1,np),v_lpcar2pf(ar2,np))
